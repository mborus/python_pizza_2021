## I Can Show You That On A Map

## Task for the day:

- Your boss gives you data. (which includes Zipcodes)
- She wants you to help her understand that data.

Note:

Customer counts, Turnover, Passenger counts...

Usually Q: "Find out where we make money"

---

## You: "I can show you that on a map!"

---

Alas you have no idea how to get started.


Note:
Added bonus problems:

- No Budget
- Windows
- IT department's virus scanner prevents pip install access
- Company data is secret and may not leave your work computer


---

## Agenda

- [Learn the workflow]
- Get the tools installed
- Run the notebook

Note:
So you can actually do it.

</section>





        


        <section data-markdown
data-separator-notes="^Note:">

## Step 1 - Geocoding

- Have Zipcode
- Want a **longitude** & a **latitude** value

(for "projection" or GCS, we use WGS84 / EPSG 4326)


Note:
No need to learn more about Geographic Coordinate System or projections at this point.
(or what the difference between these is)

There are many online services for this,
- most cost a fee
- have rate limits
- other restrictions

---

## Step 1 - Geocoding

Use [pgeocode 0.3.0](https://pypi.org/project/pgeocode/), a pip installable library that works with data from [geonames.org](http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/)

Query a list of zip codes from the same country, get a Pandas DataFrame with geo information.

Note:

This one is free and you can tweak it to work offline.
pgeocode a single python file and easy to change.

---

## Step 1 - Geocoding

Here's a pgeocode example:

![](screens/pgeocode.png )

Note:
- Group/Query by country if your data has more than one country
- Pgeocode creates a folder in your Home directory to store cache data.
- For offline usage, you need to copy that folder.

        <section data-markdown

## Step 2 - Grouping points

![](screens/h3.png )

[Uber](https://eng.uber.com/h3/)'s [H3](https://pypi.org/project/h3/) is Open Source and has Python bindings.

Note:
- "Grouping" or "Binning"
- It's also is fast and has great API documentation
- Lets you select resolution (how detailed the hexagons should be)
---

Example: get the H3 index for my home town with a resolution of 5

![](screens/h3_1.png )


Note:
- Latitude "Breitengrad" first (54), longitude "Längengrad" after  (9)
- It's a 16 byte string that's unique to H3
- store in your DataFrame for grouping

---

Example: turn the H3 index into a hexagon.

![](screens/h3_2.png )

---

Example: Validate that it worked.

![](screens/h3_3.png )

---

## Workflow:

- Add the **H3 index** as a new column to DataFrame.
- Group data by the **H3 index** into a new DataFrame
- Add a new column "geometry" to this new DataFrame
- Fill this column with Polygon data via the **H3 index**


Note:

Now we have a Pandas DataFrame, with geo information inside.

The name "geometry" is mandatory.

        <section data-markdown
data-separator-notes="^Note:">

## Step 3 - Preparing the Map

Convert Pandas DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame

![](screens/geopandas_1.png )

---

Simplified, GeoDataFrame is like a normal Pandas DataFrame, but with a column 'geometry'.

![](screens/geopandas_2.png )

Note: and a projection
---

A GeoDataFrame has extra methods, like
- *explore* to show an interactive map
- *save* to save an interactive map to html

Note:
- If you mail out that html-file to an iOS user
to see on an iPhone or iPad, they just get a blank screen.
So you need to warn receipients that they need to look at
it on a PC or send it to third party Apps like "Good Reader"
which can display the interactive map.

---

## Agenda

- Learn the workflow
- [Get the tools installed]
- Run the notebook

Note:
Now install

</section>

<!-- ![](screens/geodata_tweet.png ) -->


        


        <section data-markdown>

## Installation for Windows 10

- Download the 64bit recommended installer for Python 3.9.9
- Run installer ("For all users" preferred)
- No need to add Python to the Path.


Note:
Same operating system
Same Python 3.9.9 !
Not ready for Python 3.10 yet!
Assume: No other Python is installed.

---

### Create a virtual environment

![](screens/pip02.png )

- Open a *cmd.exe* in your User directory
- clone/download git repo & enter folder
- *py -3.9 -m venv venv*

---

Activate it

![](screens/pip03.png )

and update pip

note:
always update pip

---

## Get Windows binaries:

- GDAL‑3.3.3‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl
- Fiona-1.8.20-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
- numpy-1.21.4+mkl-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl

Source: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Note:

---

Install them manually

![](screens/pip04a.png )
![](screens/pip04b.png )
![](screens/pip04c.png )

*pip install filename*

Note:
Successfull messages

---

Install the rest:

*pip install -r requirements.txt*

![](screens/pip05.png )


Note:
This will take a few minutes. Take a break!

---

Start JupyterLab to verify it works.

*jupyter lab*

![](screens/pip07.png )



Note:

- A browser opens.
- you can now open "python_pizza_map_example.ipynb" and run it

---

## Congratulations!

You now have a working JupyterLab environment capable of showing maps.

---

## Prepare offline install (1/4)

- create folder *mkdir offline*
- enter folder *cd offline*
- *pip freeze > requirements_offline.txt*
- *pip download -r requirements_offline.txt --no-deps*
- *pip download pip*

note:
since you can't update pip
---

## Prepare offline install (2/4)

- Copy 'offline' folder to USB.
- Add a installer for the Python Version (3.9.9, 64bit)

Note: This folder includes all manually downloaded files

---

## Prepare offline install (3/4)

Finally edit the 'requirements_offline.txt'. For each local file, only keep the file name.

![](screens/offline.png )

Note:
Example:
- The Fiona line needs to start "Fiona-1.8.20...."
- Watch for special characters! "%2B" "+ in numpy filename

---
## Prepare offline install (4/4)

Reminder: The pgeocode library has kept a cache of zip code data in
your in a folder called "pgeocode" in your Home directory.

Move that folder to your USB stick as well and manually copy it.

---

## Installing offline:

- Install Python
- Create 'venv' & activate it (like before)
- Move into the "offline" folder
- *pip install -r requirements_offline.txt' --find-links . --no-index*
- run *jupyter lab* to test installation

Note:
Copy to PC
You now have an offline installation
Pgeocode locale data folder!

---

## Agenda

- Learn the workflow
- Get the tools installed
- [Run the notebook]

---

## Run the example

Open the *python_pizza_map_example.ipynb* example notebook and run the notebook cells.

Have fun exploring data on a map.

Find me on twitter @mborus or on Discord
for the rest of the day.

Note:

Thanks for your attention.

Hope this was useful and helps you is starting to work with maps.
